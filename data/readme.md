# Data

Repository contains simulation data for the all wage-flexibility scenarios with the baseline trade settings for both MM and LS worlds. There are 3 simulation examples for each of these scenario.

Names of the data files are in the format "2_RandomSeed1_RandomSeed2_WorldLabel_final_TradeCostsLabel_TradeQuotasLabel_WageFlexSettingNumber", where wage flexibility settings are numbered with respect to the following order: 
 * base-base, alt1-alt1, base-alt1, base-alt2 for MM world;
 * base-base, alt1-alt1, base-alt1, alt1-base, base-alt2, alt2-base for LS world.

Scenario list contains list of all scenarios simulated for the purpose of the thesis and corresponding number of performed simulations. For additional data for simulations not contained in this repository please contact the author at alexander.macejovsky@gmail.com.
